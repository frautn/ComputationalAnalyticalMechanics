This is the repository for the course [Computational Analytical Mechanics](https://ingenieria.unlam.edu.ar/preview.php?seccion=3&idArticulo=510), for the [mechanical engineering degree](https://ingenieria.unlam.edu.ar/index.php?seccion=3&idArticulo=371) at the [Department of Engineering and Research in Technology](https://ingenieria.unlam.edu.ar/), Universidad Nacional de La Matanza.

It's a code-based undergraduate course on analytical mechanics for engineering students with little to no prior programming knowledge. This 14-week flipped classroom course focuses on providing skills to calculate dynamics and strains of simple mechanical devices modelled as rigid bodies by solving Euler-Lagrange equations. Problems sets with increasingly complex exercises are introduced each week. Python-based solutions to previous ones are reused by students, who through small incremental modifications over the code presented by the teaching staff, build their own library of solutions to address mechanical modelling challenges.  

The material for this course is available as Jupyter notebooks, containing theory and example exercises alongside the code to solve them.
Students are required to rely on computer-based calculations, both analytical and numerical, so to focus their efforts on the physics modelling and interpretation of results. The online hosting and execution of these notebooks avoids any installation or hardware requirement issues.


## Contents
In this proposed schedule for a course of 14 weeks, the topics are divided by areas.
Some of them are covered through more than one week, so a further descriptor, _Folder_, indicates where to find each week's material.

## 05 Numerical simulations
It's time to solve the equations found using the Euler-Lagrange method. We'll put into action what we learnt in any numerical analysis course and we will determine the dynamics of the systems that we have modelled.

## 06 Constraint forces
The determination of the dynamics of each part in a device is important, but it's equally important to determine the strains that they have to withstand. Let's start calculating these torques and forces.

## 09 The inertia tensor
We now begin studying solids of increasing complexity. In the same manner that a force gives more or less acceleration to different bodies according to their masses, a torque changes more or less the angular velocity according to how the mass is distributed around the axis of rotation.
The relation is more complex than a simple scalar quantity like mass, it is the inertia tensor, which we are going to calculate for simple geometric figures for now, to then move forward to work on more realistic mechanic devices.

## 10 Euler equations
Now that you know how to write the inertia tensor of a rigid body, it's time to make it rotate.
